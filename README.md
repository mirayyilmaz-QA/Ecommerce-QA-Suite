# Ecommerce QA Suite
A comprehensive end-to-end quality engineering project for a modern e-commerce platform, covering Manual, API, UI Automation, Performance, and Database testing.

## Target Platform: Magento 2 Demo
For this project, I selected the Magento 2 Open Source Demo as my primary testing target.

## Why I Chose This Platform
* Magento is a world-class, enterprise-level e-commerce engine. Unlike simple "todo" apps or practice websites, Magento provides a high-fidelity environment with:
* Complex Business Logic: Multi-step checkout, guest vs. registered user flows, and dynamic cart updates.
* Modern Web Architecture: It heavily utilizes asynchronous JavaScript (Knockout.js) and AJAX, which are common in professional software development.
* Layered Testing Opportunities: The platform allows for deep dives into API endpoints, Database schemas (MySQL), and UI automation.


This repository serves as a showcase of my skills as a Software QA Engineer. It follows a structured roadmap to demonstrate proficiency in various testing layers:

* Manual Testing Strategy (Test Plans, Bug Reporting)
* Database Testing (MySQL)
* UI Automation (Playwright & Selenium)
* API Testing (Postman & RestAssured)
* Performance Testing (JMeter)
* Mobile Testing (Appium)
* AI in QA (Generative AI for Test Data)
