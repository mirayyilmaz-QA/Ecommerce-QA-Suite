# Project: Manual Testing – End-to-End E-commerce Scenarios

##  Overview
This portfolio showcases a comprehensive E2E manual testing project on the Magento (Adobe Commerce) Demo Store. It demonstrates my ability to analyze requirements, plan testing strategies, execute complex functional scenarios, and document critical defects with a focus on business logic,  data integrity, and end-to-end user journey.
